<div class="about">
  <p>
    <em class="heavy">hello!</em>
    👋 i'm a
    <em>year two ✌ computer science</em>
    undergrad at
    <em> <a href="https://nus.edu.sg">NUS</a> </em> from <em>singapore 🇸🇬</em>.
  </p>
  <p>
    my interests lie in
    <em>machine learning 🧠 </em>, particularly the sub-fields of
    <em>computer vision 👀</em>
    and
    <em>natural language processing 💬</em>, although recently I have found
    myself being increasingly interested in the more
    <em>theoretical aspects 📚</em> of computer science. i'm currently
    challenging myself by taking more <em>advanced courses ➕</em> on
    <em>algorithms ⚙</em>!
  </p>
  <p>
    in my free time, i enjoy <em>bouldering 🧗‍♀️</em>,
    <em>ultimate frisbee 🥏</em>, and <em>vibing</em> to some
    <em>RnB / lofi</em> tunes.
  </p>

  <p class="highlight">
    I'm currently looking for a <em>summer internship (may - july 2023)</em>!
  </p>
