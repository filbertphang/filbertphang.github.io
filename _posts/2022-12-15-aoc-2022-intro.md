I'm doing [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com)!

This will be my third time attempting Advent of Code, the first being in [2018](https://github.com/filbertphang/aoc2018) and the next in [2019](https://github.com/filbertphang/aoc2019) (which I only attempted in 2020). Unfortunately, both those attempts were incomplete &mdash; I probably got stuck on a hard problem somewhere and lost the momentum to keep going.

This year, equipped with knowledge from 2 algorithms courses here at NUS ([CS2040S Data Structures and Algorithms](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS2040S) and [CS3230 Design and Analysis of Algorithms](https://nusmods.com/modules/CS3230)), I think I'll be slightly better prepared for this than I was in previous years.

I have 3 main objectives for my attempt this year:

1. **Learn a new language.** I will be attempting to complete most if not all of the 25 problems in **C++**, and I'm hoping that through this I'll be able to gain some familiarity with the language as well as the **C++ standard library**.

2. **Write good explanations.** They say that teaching/explaining concepts to other people is one of the best ways to consolidate your learning. I'll be writing a quick analysis of the problem and my approach to formulating a solution after each day's puzzle to cement my understanding of the topic.

3. **Have fun.** I always appreciate a good challenge, and Advent of Code provides that without requiring me to have knowledge of esoteric algorithms.

The post for the first day's problem can be found [here]({% post_url 2022-12-16-aoc-2022-day01  %}). All AoC 2022 posts will be tagged with [`aoc2022`](/tag/aoc2022).

Happy coding!
