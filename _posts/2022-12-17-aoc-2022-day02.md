## Day 2: Rock Paper Scissors

_The problem statement for day 2 can be found [here](https://adventofcode.com/2022/day/2)._

_My solution for day 2 can be found [here](https://github.com/filbertphang/aoc2022/tree/main/day02)._

**Difficulty Rating: Easy**

Let $n$ refer to the number of games of rock paper scissors played.

### Part 1

Part 1 requires us to find the total score, assuming the second column refers to the move you should make.

The most straightforward solution also happens to be the optimal one! Simply iterate over all the games in the input, calculate the score for that game, and add the score for each game to the running total as you process them. Since the score for each game can be calculated in constant time with a simple `if-else` statement, this solution would run in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space.

### Part 2

Part 2 requires us to find the total score, assuming the second column refers to the end state of that match.

We just need to modify the solution in Part 1, however instead of finding the result for each game, we find the required move to attain that outcome. Since this can still be done in constant time, this solution would also run in $O(n)$ time and $O(1)$ space.
